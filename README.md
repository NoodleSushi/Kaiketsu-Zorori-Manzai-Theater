# Developer Notes
- This game has localization in English, Japanese, Spanish, Italian, and French.
  - Chinese localization is available in the source code but is currently disabled due to font display limitations.
- The option for "Oyaji Gag" subtitles is available in Japanese, but it might contain inaccuracies.
- I've hidden an Easter egg in the main menu! ;3
